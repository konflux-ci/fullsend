# Admin E2E Tests Design

End-to-end tests for the `fullsend admin install` and `fullsend admin uninstall`
CLI commands, exercising real GitHub APIs and browser-based GitHub App creation.

## Context

The admin CLI manages a 4-layer installation stack (config-repo, workflows,
secrets, enrollment) and creates GitHub Apps via the manifest flow. All existing
tests use `forge.FakeClient` or `httptest.Server` mocks. This spec defines e2e
tests that hit a real GitHub organization to verify the full install/uninstall
lifecycle.

## Decisions

- **Full layer stack coverage.** The e2e test exercises all 4 layers, not a
  subset. Install creates every resource; uninstall tears them down.
- **Real GitHub App creation via Playwright.** The manifest flow opens a browser
  to create GitHub Apps. We automate this with `playwright-go` rather than
  skipping it. If `playwright-go` proves too immature, the fallback is a Go test
  orchestrator shelling out to a Node.js Playwright script.
- **Interface injection architecture.** The existing `appsetup.BrowserOpener`
  and `appsetup.Prompter` interfaces are the seams. The e2e test injects
  Playwright-backed implementations rather than subprocess-orchestrating the CLI.
- **Dedicated test org: `halfsend`.** A manually-created GitHub org with a bot
  user (`botsend`) that has admin access. The org name is hardcoded in tests.
- **Persistent browser context for auth.** A one-time manual login saves
  Playwright state. Test runs reuse this state without re-authenticating.
- **Dual cleanup strategy.** Teardown-first (delete stale resources before each
  run) combined with `t.Cleanup()` deferred cleanup (catch mid-test failures).
- **App deletion via Playwright UI.** Cleanup deletes GitHub Apps by navigating
  to their settings pages and clicking delete, rather than using JWT-based API
  auth.

## File Structure

```
e2e/
  admin/
    admin_test.go        # TestAdminInstallUninstall
    browser.go           # PlaywrightBrowserOpener (appsetup.BrowserOpener)
    prompter.go          # AutoPrompter (appsetup.Prompter)
    cleanup.go           # Teardown-first + deferred cleanup helpers
    testutil.go          # Shared test helpers (env var loading, client setup)
    cmd/
      setup-auth/
        main.go          # One-time interactive auth state bootstrap
```

All files use `//go:build e2e` so they never compile during `go test ./...`.

## Configuration

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `E2E_GITHUB_TOKEN` | Yes | PAT for the `botsend` user with org admin, repo, delete_repo scopes |
| `E2E_BROWSER_STATE_DIR` | Yes | Path to Playwright persistent browser context (pre-authenticated as botsend) |

The test org (`halfsend`) and bot user (`botsend`) are constants in the test
code, not configurable.

## Function Access

The `runAppSetup()`, `runInstall()`, `runUninstall()`, and `runAnalyze()`
functions are unexported in the `cli` package. The e2e test does NOT call them
directly. Instead, the test reproduces the wiring logic from `admin.go`:

1. Creates a `github.LiveClient` with the token.
2. Creates a `ui.Printer`.
3. Constructs `appsetup.Setup` with injected Playwright implementations.
4. Calls `setup.Run()` for each role (same as `runAppSetup` does).
5. Discovers repos, builds config, builds the layer stack, calls
   `stack.InstallAll()` / `stack.UninstallAll()` / `stack.AnalyzeAll()`.

This duplicates some wiring but keeps the test decoupled from the CLI package
internals. The wiring is simple (constructing structs and calling public APIs)
and unlikely to drift.

## Test Org Prerequisites

The `halfsend` org must contain at least one repository (besides `.fullsend`)
for enrollment testing. A repo named `test-repo` should exist with a `main`
branch and at least one commit. This repo is created manually once and left
in place across test runs.

The test enables `test-repo` for enrollment via `--repo test-repo` equivalent
(passing `[]string{"test-repo"}` to the config builder).

## Test Flow

`TestAdminInstallUninstall` is a single test function that exercises the full
lifecycle:

### Phase 1: Teardown-first cleanup

Scan the `halfsend` org and delete stale resources from previous runs:

1. Delete the `.fullsend` repo if it exists.
2. List org installations. For any with slug matching `fullsend-halfsend*`,
   use Playwright to navigate to the app settings page and delete the app.
3. Close any open PRs in test repos that were created by previous runs.

### Phase 2: Install

1. Create a `github.LiveClient` using `E2E_GITHUB_TOKEN`.
2. Initialize a Playwright browser from the persistent context at
   `E2E_BROWSER_STATE_DIR`.
3. Construct `appsetup.Setup` with:
   - `PlaywrightBrowserOpener` as the `BrowserOpener`
   - `AutoPrompter` as the `Prompter`
   - The live GitHub client
4. Call `appsetup.Setup.Run()` for all 4 default roles (fullsend, triage,
   coder, review).
   - For each role, `PlaywrightBrowserOpener.Open()` navigates to the local
     manifest form URL, follows the redirect to GitHub, and clicks "Create
     GitHub App" on GitHub's confirmation page.
   - After creation, if the app isn't auto-installed, Playwright navigates to
     the installation URL and clicks "Install".
5. Register `t.Cleanup()` to delete each created app (via Playwright settings
   page automation).
6. Build the layer stack and call `stack.InstallAll()` with the returned
   credentials.
   - Register `t.Cleanup()` to delete the `.fullsend` repo.

### Phase 3: Verify install

Assert via the GitHub API (using the live client):

1. `.fullsend` repo exists in `halfsend`.
2. `config.yaml` exists and parses as a valid `config.OrgConfig`.
3. Workflow files exist: `.github/workflows/agent.yaml`,
   `.github/workflows/repo-onboard.yaml`, `CODEOWNERS`.
4. Secrets exist for each role: `FULLSEND_<ROLE>_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`.
5. Variables exist for each role: `FULLSEND_<ROLE>_APP_ID`.
6. Enrollment PRs were created for any enabled repos.

### Phase 4: Analyze

Build a fresh layer stack and call `stack.AnalyzeAll()`. Assert all layers
report `StatusInstalled`.

### Phase 5: Uninstall

Build a minimal layer stack (same as `runUninstall` does) and call
`stack.UninstallAll()`. No confirmation prompt needed since we're calling
the stack directly, not the CLI.

### Phase 6: Verify uninstall

1. Assert `.fullsend` repo no longer exists (API returns 404).
2. Assert enrollment PRs are still open (uninstall doesn't close them by
   design -- this may change).

### Phase 7: Cleanup

`t.Cleanup()` handlers run in LIFO order:
1. Delete GitHub Apps via Playwright UI automation.
2. Delete `.fullsend` repo if it still exists (safety net).
3. Close any enrollment PRs.

## PlaywrightBrowserOpener

Implements `appsetup.BrowserOpener`. Wraps a `playwright-go` browser with
persistent context.

```go
type PlaywrightBrowserOpener struct {
    page playwright.Page
}

func (b *PlaywrightBrowserOpener) Open(ctx context.Context, url string) error {
    // Navigate to the URL (either local manifest form or GitHub install page)
    b.page.Goto(url)

    // Detect which page we're on and act accordingly:
    // 1. Local manifest form → auto-submits, redirects to GitHub
    // 2. GitHub "Register new GitHub App" → click "Create GitHub App" button
    // 3. GitHub app install page → click "Install" button
    //
    // Wait for navigation to complete and handle each case.
}
```

Key implementation details:

- The manifest form auto-submits via JavaScript, so Playwright just needs to
  wait for the GitHub confirmation page to load.
- On GitHub's "Register new GitHub App" page, click the submit/create button.
- On the app installation page, select "All repositories" and click "Install".
- After the GitHub App is created, GitHub redirects back to the local callback
  URL. Playwright follows this redirect, which delivers the code to the local
  HTTP server. The `appsetup` code handles the code exchange.
- Each `Open()` call blocks until the browser interaction completes and the
  page navigates to a terminal state (success page or callback).

## AutoPrompter

Implements `appsetup.Prompter` for non-interactive use:

```go
type AutoPrompter struct{}

func (AutoPrompter) WaitForEnter(prompt string) error {
    return nil // No human needed; Playwright handled the browser interaction
}

func (AutoPrompter) Confirm(prompt string) (bool, error) {
    return true, nil // Always accept (reuse existing apps, etc.)
}
```

## App Deletion via Playwright

GitHub Apps can be deleted through their settings page at
`https://github.com/settings/apps/<slug>`. The Playwright-based cleanup:

1. Navigate to `https://github.com/settings/apps/<slug>/advanced`.
2. Scroll to the "Danger zone" section.
3. Click "Delete GitHub App".
4. Confirm the deletion in the modal dialog.

This is called both during teardown-first cleanup and via `t.Cleanup()`.

## CI Integration

`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`:

```yaml
name: E2E Tests
on:
  push:
    paths: ['**/*.go', 'go.mod', 'go.sum']
  pull_request:
    paths: ['**/*.go', 'go.mod', 'go.sum']
  workflow_dispatch:

concurrency:
  group: e2e-halfsend
  cancel-in-progress: false  # Let running tests finish; don't corrupt state

jobs:
  e2e:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 15
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v5
        with:
          go-version-file: go.mod
      - name: Install Playwright browsers
        run: go run github.com/playwright-community/playwright-go/cmd/playwright install --with-deps chromium
      - name: Restore browser auth state
        run: echo "$E2E_BROWSER_STATE" | base64 -d | tar xz -C /tmp/pw-state
        env:
          E2E_BROWSER_STATE: ${{ secrets.E2E_BROWSER_STATE }}
      - name: Run e2e tests
        run: go test -tags e2e -v -timeout 10m ./e2e/admin/
        env:
          E2E_GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.E2E_GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          E2E_BROWSER_STATE_DIR: /tmp/pw-state
```

Key details:
- `concurrency.group: e2e-halfsend` prevents parallel runs from colliding on
  the shared test org.
- `cancel-in-progress: false` lets running tests complete their cleanup rather
  than being killed mid-mutation.
- Browser auth state is stored as a base64-encoded tarball in a repository
  secret. This needs periodic refresh when the GitHub session expires.

## Auth State Bootstrap

A one-time setup tool at `e2e/admin/cmd/setup-auth/main.go`:

1. Launches Playwright with a visible Chromium browser (headed mode).
2. Navigates to `https://github.com/login`.
3. Prints instructions: "Log in as botsend, then press Enter in the terminal."
4. Waits for the developer to complete login (including 2FA if needed).
5. Saves the browser storage state to the specified directory.
6. Prints instructions for converting to a CI secret:
   `tar czf - -C <dir> . | base64 > state.b64`

Usage:
```
E2E_BROWSER_STATE_DIR=/tmp/pw-state go run ./e2e/admin/cmd/setup-auth/
```

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| `playwright-go` immaturity | Fallback: shell out to Node.js Playwright script from Go test |
| GitHub UI changes break selectors | Use data-testid or role-based selectors where possible; accept some fragility |
| Browser auth state expires | Document refresh process; CI job can alert on auth failures |
| Rate limiting on GitHub API | Single test run with cleanup; concurrency group prevents parallel runs |
| Test leaves orphaned resources | Dual cleanup (teardown-first + t.Cleanup) catches most cases; manual cleanup documented |
| Flaky network/API responses | Retry logic for API calls; generous timeouts; test marked as flaky-tolerant in CI |

## Out of Scope

- Testing the `fullsend admin analyze` command as a standalone flow (it's
  exercised as a verification step within the install test).
- Testing with multiple repos enabled (start with 0-1 enabled repos to keep
  the test fast).
- Testing the dry-run flag.
- Testing error recovery (e.g., partial install failure).
- Automating GitHub App installation approval (the manifest flow auto-installs
  for org-owned apps created by org admins).
