## Issue

**app crashes when I save**

The app keeps crashing whenever I try to save. This is really frustrating because I keep losing my work. Please fix this ASAP.

Thanks for reporting this — I understand how frustrating it is to lose work. I want to help get this resolved quickly.

To start narrowing this down: **where exactly in TaskFlow are you when the crash happens?** For example, are you saving a new task, editing an existing task, updating project settings, or something else? And when you say "crashes," what exactly do you see — does the app freeze, close entirely, show an error message, or something else?

Also, was this working for you before? If so, do you recall roughly when it started happening?

I'm editing my task list and hitting Save in the toolbar. The whole app just closes on me. I think there's some error dialog that flashes for a split second but I can't read it before everything disappears. It started maybe a week or two ago? I don't remember exactly. It was working fine before that.

Thanks for those details — that's really helpful. The flashing error dialog is a strong clue and I'd love to capture it.

Could you try to reproduce the crash and, right before you hit Save, **open your OS's screen recorder or press Print Screen repeatedly** so we can catch that error? On Windows you can also check **Event Viewer → Windows Logs → Application** for a crash entry, or on Mac check **Console.app** for recent crash logs around the time it happens.

Also, two quick specifics:
1. **What platform are you on?** (Windows/Mac/Linux, and which version of TaskFlow — you can usually find this under Help → About)
2. **Does it happen every single time you hit Save, or only sometimes?** If only sometimes, is there anything different about the times it works vs. doesn't (e.g., number of tasks, specific task content)?

I'm on Mac, macOS 14.2, TaskFlow 2.3.1. It happens every time I hit Save. I don't really have time to mess around with screen recorders, I just need this fixed. I have like 200 tasks in there and it crashes every single time. I think the error says something about encoding but it disappears so fast I can barely see it.

Got it, no worries about the screen recorder — Mac actually saves crash reports automatically. Could you do this:

1. **Open Finder → Go → Go to Folder** and paste: `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports`
2. Look for any file with "TaskFlow" in the name and paste its contents here (or just the first 20 lines).

And one more thing — since the error mentions **encoding**: do any of your 200 tasks contain **emoji, accented characters, or non-English text** (e.g., café, naïve, 🎯, or anything with special symbols)? I'm asking because an encoding bug during save would crash exactly the way you're describing, and it would explain why it started recently if a new task with those characters was added around the same time.

I don't really want to go digging through system folders... look, now that you mention it, I did import a bunch of tasks from a CSV file right around when this started. Some of those tasks might have weird characters in them, I pulled the data from a Word document so probably fancy quotes and dashes and stuff like that. But I mean, that's not exactly exotic, the app should be able to handle that.

### triage-agent

You're absolutely right — the app should handle those characters, and this sounds like a bug on our side. I have a strong theory: the Word-originated characters in your CSV import (smart quotes, em-dashes, etc.) are hitting an encoding bug in the save path.

One quick test to confirm before I hand this off to the dev team: **could you create a brand-new, empty task list, add one plain-text task like "test task," and try saving that?** If that saves fine, it confirms the imported data is the trigger and we'll know exactly where to look.

You wouldn't need to delete your real data — just a throwaway list to test with.

Yeah fine, a new list with a simple task saves no problem. It's only my main list with all my imported stuff that crashes. Can you guys just fix it already?

[RESOLVED] {"title":"App crashes on save when task list contains non-ASCII characters from CSV import (smart quotes, em-dashes)","problem":"TaskFlow crashes immediately (app closes) every time the user hits Save in the toolbar when the task list contains tasks imported from a CSV file that originated from a Word document. The CSV data contains Word-style typographic characters such as smart quotes (“”), em-dashes (—), and similar non-ASCII glyphs. A flashing error dialog mentioning 'encoding' appears briefly before the app closes. Saving a new list with plain ASCII tasks works fine.","root_cause_hypothesis":"The save/serialization path is not handling non-ASCII characters (specifically Windows-1252 or UTF-8 multi-byte characters like smart quotes and em-dashes) correctly. Most likely the save routine assumes ASCII or uses a strict encoding mode that throws a fatal exception on encountering these characters, rather than encoding them properly as UTF-8. This may have been introduced or exposed in a recent update (the user reports it worked before, timeline ~1-2 weeks).","reproduction_steps":["Create a CSV file containing tasks with Word-style smart quotes (“ ”), em-dashes (—), or other non-ASCII typographic characters","Import the CSV into TaskFlow as a task list","Click Save in the toolbar","Observe: app crashes with a brief encoding-related error dialog"],"environment":"macOS 14.2 (Sonoma), TaskFlow 2.3.1.

All edits are lost on every save attempt. No workaround exists short of removing the imported tasks. Any user who imports CSV data containing non-ASCII characters would hit this.","recommended_fix":"Investigate the save/serialization code path for encoding handling. Ensure all file writes use UTF-8 encoding (or at minimum handle multi-byte and extended-ASCII characters gracefully). Check for recent changes to the save path in the last 2-3 weeks that may have introduced a regression. Also verify the CSV import path — it may be ingesting data in one encoding but the save path may assume another.","proposed_test_case":"Create a task list containing tasks with smart quotes (“” ‘’), em-dashes (—), accented characters (é, ç, ñ), and emoji.
