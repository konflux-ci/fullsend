## Issue

**app crashes when I save**

The app keeps crashing whenever I try to save. This is really frustrating because I keep losing my work. Please fix this ASAP.

Thanks for reporting this — sorry you're losing work, that's definitely frustrating.

To help us track this down, could you tell us what you were saving when the crash happens?

- A) Creating or editing a task
- B) Saving project or workspace settings
- C) Exporting or downloading data
- D) Something else (please describe)

Also, does the crash happen *every* time you save, or only sometimes?

It's when I'm editing tasks, so A I guess. And yeah it happens every single time I hit Save. I've tried like 10 times now. I just need this fixed, I have a deadline.

### triage-agent

Thanks for confirming — a 100% reproducible crash is actually helpful for tracking this down.

One more question: when you're editing a task and hit Save, what kind of changes are you making?

- A) Editing the task title or description text
- B) Changing dates, assignees, or other task fields
- C) Adding or modifying attachments/files
- D) It crashes no matter what field I change

This will help us pinpoint exactly where the crash is happening.

Honestly I don't know, it just crashes when I hit Save. I don't think it matters what I'm changing. Look, it was working fine before, and then it just started crashing. Can you just look at the crash logs or something?

### triage-agent

Understood — we'll definitely look at the logs on our side. One last thing that will help us narrow this down fast:

Do you remember roughly when this started? Specifically:

- A) Right after an app update or version change
- B) After I changed something in my account or project settings
- C) It just started happening one day, nothing obviously changed
- D) I'm a new user, it's never worked for me

This tells us whether to look at a recent code change or something specific to your account. Either way, we have enough to start investigating — thanks for your patience.

I mean, I did import a bunch of data from a CSV file around the time it started happening. But I don't think that should break the save button. It was working fine before that, so maybe C? I don't know. Can someone just fix it?

### triage-agent

That CSV import is actually a really useful clue — that's very likely related.

Quick question that will help us zero in on the fix: does the crash happen on **every** task, or only on tasks that came from that CSV import?

- A) It crashes on the imported tasks (I haven't tried editing tasks I created manually)
- B) It crashes on ALL tasks, including ones I created before the import
- C) I'm not sure which tasks came from the import

If it's A or C, no worries — our team can check the imported data directly. We're close to having everything we need to get this fixed for you.

### reporter

I'm not really sure honestly. I think it crashes on everything but I haven't really paid close attention to which tasks were imported. I just know I have like 200 tasks and hitting Save crashes the whole app every time. Although... now that you mention it, I had a smaller project with maybe 30-40 tasks and that one saves fine. So maybe it's something about this specific project? I don't know, can you just look into it?

[RESOLVED] {"title":"App crashes on task save in project with CSV-imported data","problem":"The application crashes every time the user attempts to save any task edit in a project containing approximately 200 tasks, many of which were bulk-imported via CSV. A separate, smaller project (~30-40 tasks, no CSV import) saves without issue. The crash is 100% reproducible and is causing the reporter to lose work.","root_cause_hypothesis":"The CSV import likely introduced malformed or edge-case data (e.g., special characters, excessively long field values, invalid enum values, or encoding issues) that causes a crash during the save/serialization path. The save operation may be loading or validating related tasks or project-level data, causing even non-imported tasks in the same project to trigger the crash. An alternative hypothesis is a project-size-related issue (200 vs 30-40 tasks), but the CSV import timing correlation makes data corruption more likely.","reproduction_steps":["Identify the reporter's affected project (the one with ~200 tasks including CSV-imported data)","Open any task in that project for editing","Make any change to any field","Click Save","Observe crash (should be 100% reproducible)"],"environment":"Not specified — reproducible regardless of field edited. Reporter has multiple projects; only the project with CSV-imported data is affected.","severity":"high","impact":"User is completely blocked from editing any tasks in their primary project (~200 tasks). They are losing work on every save attempt and have an active deadline. Any user who has done a large CSV import may be similarly affected.","recommended_fix":"1. Pull crash logs for this user's save attempts to identify the exact failure point (serialization, validation, database write, etc.). 2. Inspect the CSV-imported data in the affected project for malformed entries — look for special characters, encoding issues, overly long strings, null/invalid values in required fields. 3. Compare the data schema of the working project vs the broken one. 4. If the root cause is malformed data, fix the data and add validation to the CSV import pipeline to reject or sanitize bad input. 5. If the root cause is project size, investigate the save path for N+1 queries or memory issues with large task counts.","proposed_test_case":"Import a CSV file containing edge-case data (special characters, very long strings, empty required fields, mixed encodings) into a project, then verify that all tasks in that project can be saved without crashing. Additionally, test saving in a project with 200+ tasks to rule out scale-related issues.","information_gaps":["Exact error message or stack trace (available from server crash logs)","Browser and OS (unlikely to matter given the data-correlation evidence, but available from user-agent logs)","Exact contents of the imported CSV file (inspectable from the database or import history)","Whether other users who imported CSVs experience the same issue (queryable from logs)"]}
