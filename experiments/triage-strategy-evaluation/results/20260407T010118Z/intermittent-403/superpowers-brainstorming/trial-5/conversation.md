## Issue

**Getting random 403 Forbidden errors on the dashboard**

I keep getting 403 errors when I try to access the TaskFlow dashboard. It's not every time — sometimes it loads fine, sometimes I get a 403 page. It seems totally random. My permissions haven't changed and other people on my team say they're seeing it too. Started happening a couple days ago.

Thanks for reporting this — intermittent 403s are frustrating. To help narrow this down, when you get the 403, which of these best describes the situation?

1. **Fresh page load** — I navigate to the dashboard URL (or refresh) and sometimes get a 403
2. **Mid-session** — the dashboard loads fine, but after a while it suddenly shows 403 (e.g., when clicking around or after being idle)
3. **After logging in** — it tends to happen right after I sign in
4. **Something else**

This will help us figure out whether it's likely a session/auth issue vs. an infrastructure routing problem.

It's #1 — fresh page load. I'll navigate to the dashboard or hit refresh and sometimes it works, sometimes I get the 403. It doesn't seem to matter if I just logged in or have been using it for a while. Like I said it feels random, maybe like a network issue? Roughly 1 out of every 3 times it fails if I had to guess.

Thanks, the pattern you're describing — roughly 1-in-3 fresh loads failing with a 403 across multiple team members — sounds like it could be a load balancer issue, where one out of several backend servers is rejecting requests (maybe a misconfigured or newly deployed instance).

Do you know if any of the following happened around the time this started?

1. **A deployment or release** went out for TaskFlow
2. **Infrastructure change** — e.g., new servers added, autoscaling event, config update
3. **Auth/permissions system change** — SSO provider update, API key rotation, etc.
4. **No idea** — nothing was announced and I don't have visibility into infra

This will help us point developers at the right layer to investigate.

I think there was a deployment a couple days ago — around when this started. I remember hearing something about a new role being added to the system. I was actually just assigned the new 'analyst' role right around that time. I don't have visibility into the infrastructure side of things though, so I'm not sure exactly what changed on the backend. Could the deployment have something to do with it?

That deployment and the new 'analyst' role are very likely connected to this. Quick question that will help us zero in on the cause:

The teammates who are also seeing the 403s — do they also have the new 'analyst' role, or are people **without** that role seeing it too?

1. **Only 'analyst' role users** — everyone seeing 403s has the new role
2. **Mixed** — some people without the 'analyst' role are also hitting 403s
3. **Not sure** — I'd have to check with them

This will tell us whether to focus on the role/permissions configuration or a broader deployment issue.

Hmm, I'm not 100% sure. I know at least one of the people who mentioned it to me also just got the analyst role. I'd have to check with the others — I don't know offhand what roles everyone has. I *think* it might be just the analyst role people but I don't want to say for certain.

[RESOLVED] {"title":"Intermittent 403 Forbidden on dashboard for users with new 'analyst' role after recent deployment","problem":"Users are receiving 403 Forbidden errors on approximately 1 in 3 fresh page loads of the TaskFlow dashboard. The issue began shortly after a deployment that introduced a new 'analyst' role. Multiple team members are affected, and at least the confirmed cases have the new 'analyst' role assigned.","root_cause_hypothesis":"The recent deployment added the 'analyst' role but its dashboard access permissions were not consistently applied across all backend instances. With multiple servers behind a load balancer, requests routed to an instance missing the 'analyst' role's authorization grant return 403, while instances with the correct configuration serve the page normally. This explains both the intermittent pattern and the ~1-in-3 failure rate.","reproduction_steps":["Ensure the user account has the 'analyst' role assigned","Navigate to the TaskFlow dashboard URL","Refresh the page repeatedly (roughly 1 in 3 loads should return 403)","Note: the issue is on fresh page loads, not mid-session"],"environment":"TaskFlow dashboard, post-deployment that introduced the 'analyst' role (approximately 2 days before report). Multiple users affected. No specific browser/OS constraints reported — issue appears server-side.","severity":"high","impact":"Users with the 'analyst' role are intermittently locked out of the dashboard. This blocks their workflow roughly a third of the time and affects multiple team members. The inconsistency also erodes user trust in the application's reliability.","recommended_fix":"1. Compare the authorization/role-permission configuration across all backend instances serving the dashboard — look for instances that do not grant dashboard access to the 'analyst' role. 2. Check the deployment rollout: verify whether all instances received the role configuration update, or if some are running a stale config. 3. Ensure the 'analyst' role has an explicit 'allow' entry for the dashboard route in the permissions matrix. 4. Redeploy or sync configuration across all instances and verify consistent behavior.","proposed_test_case":"Assign a test user the 'analyst' role and make 20+ sequential requests to the dashboard endpoint, recording which backend instance handles each request (via response headers or logs). Verify that all instances return 200 and none return 403. Additionally, add an integration test that asserts all defined roles (including 'analyst') have the expected permissions for core routes like the dashboard.","information_gaps":["Whether any users without the 'analyst' role are also affected (reporter was uncertain — developer can verify via access logs)","Exact number of backend instances and which specific ones may be misconfigured","Whether the role permission config is stored in code, a database, or an external auth service"]}
