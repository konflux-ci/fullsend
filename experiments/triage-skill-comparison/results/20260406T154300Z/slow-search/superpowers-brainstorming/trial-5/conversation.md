# Conversation: slow-search x superpowers-brainstorming

## Issue

**Search is really slow**

The search feature used to be fast but now it takes forever. Sometimes it takes 10-15 seconds to get results. I have a lot of tasks but this seems excessive. Running TaskFlow on my work laptop.

Thanks for reporting this! To help narrow down the cause, do you recall roughly when search started slowing down?

1. **After a TaskFlow update** — it was fast on one version and slow on the next
2. **Gradually over time** — it got slower as you added more tasks
3. **Suddenly, without an obvious change** — one day it was just slow
4. **Something else**

Also, roughly how many tasks are we talking about — hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands?

### reporter

It was after an update — I upgraded from v2.2 to v2.3 about two weeks ago and I'm pretty sure that's when it started. Search was snappy before that. I have around 5,000 tasks, been using TaskFlow for about 2 years now.

[RESOLVED] {"title":"Search performance regression in v2.3 (~10-15s latency with ~5,000 tasks)","problem":"After upgrading from v2.2 to v2.3, search latency increased from sub-second to 10-15 seconds. The reporter has approximately 5,000 tasks accumulated over 2 years of use. Search was consistently fast on v2.2.","root_cause_hypothesis":"A change introduced in v2.3 degraded search performance — likely a modified query that lost an index, a switch from indexed database search to in-memory/full-scan filtering, or a newly added search feature (e.g., full-text search across more fields) that wasn't optimized for larger datasets.","reproduction_steps":["Set up a TaskFlow instance with ~5,000 tasks (or use a seed/fixture script to generate them)","Run search on v2.2 and record latency","Upgrade to v2.3 and run the same search query","Observe 10-15 second response time on v2.3"],"environment":"TaskFlow v2.3 (upgraded from v2.2), running on a work laptop, ~5,000 tasks","severity":"high","impact":"Search is a core workflow feature. A 10-15 second delay on every search makes the application feel broken for any user with a non-trivial number of tasks. Likely affects all v2.3 users at scale, not just this reporter.","recommended_fix":"Diff all search-related code between v2.2 and v2.3 (query logic, ORM calls, database migrations). Check for missing or dropped indexes, new unindexed columns added to search scope, or removal of pagination/query limits. Profile the search query with EXPLAIN/ANALYZE on a 5,000-task dataset to identify the bottleneck.","proposed_test_case":"Add a performance/benchmark test that runs a search query against a dataset of 5,000+ tasks and asserts that results are returned within an acceptable threshold (e.g., under 2 seconds). This test should run against the search path to catch future regressions.","information_gaps":["Whether the slowness affects all search queries equally or only certain search terms/filters","Whether the database backend or storage engine was also changed during the upgrade","Exact laptop specs (CPU, RAM, disk type) — unlikely to be the root cause given the version correlation but could be a contributing factor"]}
