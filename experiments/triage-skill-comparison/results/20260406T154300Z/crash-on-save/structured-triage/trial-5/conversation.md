## Issue

**app crashes when I save**

The app keeps crashing whenever I try to save. This is really frustrating because I keep losing my work. Please fix this ASAP.

Thanks for reporting this — I can see how frustrating losing your work would be.

To help us track this down, could you describe exactly what happens when the app crashes? For example:
- Does the app close entirely, or does it freeze/become unresponsive?
- Do you see any error message or dialog before it crashes?
- What kind of task are you saving when this happens (e.g., a new task, editing an existing one)?

Any of those details would really help us narrow things down.

The app closes entirely — it just disappears. Right before it closes, I see a quick flash of some error dialog that mentions something about 'encoding' but it's gone so fast I can't read the whole thing. This happens when I'm editing an existing task list, not creating a new one. I have about 200 tasks in the list and I'm clicking the Save button in the toolbar.

Thanks for those details — the encoding error flash and the large task list are really helpful clues.

Could you let us know what environment you're running TaskFlow in? Specifically:
- What operating system are you on (e.g., Windows 11, macOS Sonoma, Ubuntu 24.04)?
- Which version of TaskFlow are you using (you can find this under Help → About)?
- Are you using the desktop app or the web version, and if web, which browser?

This will help us reproduce the issue on our end.

I'm on macOS 14.2 (Sonoma), using TaskFlow v2.3.1, and it's the desktop app.

[RESOLVED] {"title":"Desktop app crashes with encoding error when saving large existing task list","problem":"TaskFlow desktop app crashes (closes entirely) when the user clicks the Save button in the toolbar while editing an existing task list containing approximately 200 tasks. A brief encoding-related error dialog flashes before the app closes, causing the user to lose unsaved work.","root_cause_hypothesis":"The save/serialization path likely encounters a character encoding issue when processing a large task list — possibly a task contains special or non-ASCII characters that trigger an unhandled encoding exception during serialization, and the error handler or crash reporter briefly shows a dialog before the process exits.","reproduction_steps":["Open TaskFlow v2.3.1 desktop app on macOS 14.2","Open an existing task list containing approximately 200 tasks","Make an edit to one or more tasks","Click the Save button in the toolbar","Observe: app crashes (closes entirely) with a brief flash of an encoding-related error dialog"],"environment":"macOS 14.2 (Sonoma), TaskFlow v2.3.1, desktop app","severity":"high","impact":"Users with large existing task lists lose all unsaved work when attempting to save.

Look for unhandled exceptions in the encoding/serialization layer, particularly with special characters, emoji, or non-ASCII text in task fields.

Also investigate whether the large list size (200 tasks) contributes (e.g., buffer overflow or memory issue during serialization).","proposed_test_case":"Create a task list with 200+ tasks including tasks containing special characters (emoji, accented characters, CJK characters, etc.), edit a task, and verify that clicking Save completes successfully without crashing.
